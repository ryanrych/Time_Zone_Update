# Time_Zone_Update
A Python program that updates my company's time zone information


The spreadsheet can be seen in the file TimeZones.csv

The columns are defined as:
  Continent/City
  GMT offset in seconds
  Daylight Savings Amount in Seconds
  Daylight Savings Start Month
  Daylight Savings Start Week
  Daylight Savings Start Day
  Daylight Savings Start Hour
  Daylight Savings End Month
  Daylight Savings End Week
  Daylight Savings End Way
  Daylight Savings End Hour
  Daylight Savings End Second

The program gets all of this data from https://www.timeanddate.com/ and creates a new csv file with the current date in the title.
